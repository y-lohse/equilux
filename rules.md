Equilux – Rules
Setup
* Use a 52-card deck (J/Q/K = 10, A = 1 or 11).
* Each player chooses Sun or Moon and receives 3 orbs (tokens).
* Place the Balance Marker at 0 on a track from −6 (Moon) to +6 (Sun).
* Set difficulty level to 1 (easiest).
* Randomly assign initiative.

Turn Sequence
1. Orb Wager (Defender Only)
    * The non-active player secretly wagers 0–3 orbs.
    * Each orb narrows the valid pulse range (default 18–24) by 1 at each end (e.g., 2 orbs → 20–22).
2. Pulse (Initiator Only)
    * Draw up to N = 8 − difficulty cards, one at a time.
    * After each draw, choose to keep or discard.
    * The pulse ends when the player stops or after N draws.
    * Total the values of kept cards.
3. Resolution
    * If total is within the adjusted range:
        * Pulse succeeds
        * Keep initiative
        * Move Balance Marker 1 step toward your side
        * Increase difficulty (max 6)
        * Defender loses wagered orbs
    * Otherwise:
        * Pulse fails
        * Pass initiative
        * Decrease difficulty (min 1)
        * Balance Marker does not move
        * Defender keeps wagered orbs

Victory
First to move the Balance Marker to their extreme end (−6 for Moon, +6 for Sun) wins.
