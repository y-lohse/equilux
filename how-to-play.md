Winning

This marker designates the active and the difficulty level.

When the active player wins a round, the passive player looses a life and the difficulty increases.

When the active player loses a round, the passive player wins a life, the difficulty decreases, and the marker is turned over.

The game ends when one player runs out of lives.

____

Playing

1. Passive player secretly bets tokens.
2. Active player draws a card from the deck.
3. They decide whether to add the card to their hand or discard it.
4. They can then choose to hit (request another card) or stay (score the current hand).
5. If they hit, they draw another card and repeat steps 3-4.

Scoring

Hands are scored using Blackjack rules.

By betting tokens, the defender decides how close to 21 the attacker must get to win the round.

0 tokens = 21±3 points
1 token = 21±2 points
2 tokens = 21±1 points
3 tokens = 21 points

Betted tokens are lost if the attacker wins the round.
